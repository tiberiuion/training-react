## Concepts
Components

Passing data trhough props

Making components interactive
-    Defined a custom function
-    Used it on the onclick attribute

Adding state to a component
 
 Lifting state up

 "To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other, declare the shared state in their parent component instead. The parent component can pass that state back down to the children via props. This keeps the child components in sync with each other and with their parent."
